        What is the architecture your docker image is using? You can easily find out by executing this 
        
        ```shell
        docker exec -it [container-name] /bin/sh -c 'apk --print-arch'
        ```
        in your running container.

        Example output:
        
        ```
        amd64
        ```
      multiple: true
      options:
        - x86
        - amd64
        - arm/v6
        - arm/v7
        - arm64

      label: Relevant log output
      description: |
        Please copy and paste any relevant log output. This will be automatically formatted into code, so no need for markdown backticks. 
        
        For example, in order to view the last 200 log lines from the container you can run:

        ```shell
        docker logs --tail 200 [container-name]
        ```

        You can also append the Apache error or access logs by issuing the commands:

        ```shell
        docker exec -it [container-name] /bin/sh -c 'cat /var/log/apache2/error.log'

        # AND

        docker exec -it [container-name] /bin/sh -c 'cat /var/log/apache2/access.log
        ```
      render: shell
